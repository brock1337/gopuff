# goPuff Cart

## Notes
The server package was going to be the middleware that would do more complex processing.  However, it is mainly a functioning skeleton.  This is because after reading the instructions, I thought the backend / middleware would be important.  Due to the complexity being mainly frontend except for two API calls, this is more-or-less overkill for this implementation.

The primary focus of the solution is in the ```/client``` folder

## Server & Client
```
  npm install-all
  npm start
```

## Client
Details and directions for the client application are within it's directory
